## About the Project

Whether you're a professional chef or just a food enthusiast, Gastronome is a tool to explore new food pairings. By assigning levels to different ingredients based on their umami and flavor profiles, this app encourages users to experiment with combinations they may have never considered.

## How It Works

1. **Ingredient Levels**: Foods are assigned flavor levels based on their umami profile, which helps you match them with complementary ingredients.
2. **Discover New Flavors**: Use the app to input ingredients and generate unique combinations that enhance flavor harmony.
3. **Expand Culinary Horizons**: Gastronome is perfect for chefs looking for innovative recipe ideas or food lovers eager to explore interesting flavor pairings.
